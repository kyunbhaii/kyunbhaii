## 🎓 What Drives Me

I'm passionate about building AI that feels human. Whether it's tracking movement in real-time, understanding natural language nuances, helping people discover products they'll love, or creating intelligent assistants that actually understand context — I focus on making AI that's both powerful and intuitive.

I believe the best AI systems don't just work technically; they solve real problems in ways that feel natural to users. That's why I'm excited about GenAI — it's pushing the boundaries of what's possible in human-AI interaction.
